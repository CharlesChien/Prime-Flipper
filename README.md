## Prime Flipper

“Prime Flipper” is an Android app that implements Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find and display prime numbers.

This app contains three pages. First, it’s a splash screen – it simply stays for a few seconds, and then goes to the next page - nothing more than that. 

Second, it shows a TextEdit field that allows you to enter a Java Integer value – it warns you if you are not entering a valid value. Once a valid number is entered and “Check” button clicked, it displays whether it’s a prime number (e.g. 2147483647 is a prime number), or it’s a composite number (e.g. 2147483644 is a composite number: 2 x 2 x 233 x 113 x 2089).

By swiping your finger to the left of the screen, you will see a third page comes up. It started with a GridView of numbers from 1 to 500 as the first page. You will find prime numbers in red text with a white background, and composite numbers in dark grey with light grey background. You can touch any of the number, and its prime divisors will come up in a Toast. In order to go to the next range of numbers, you will need to flip your finger up or down – up to see numbers larger than what you are seeing, and down smaller. 

Thanks for looking.
